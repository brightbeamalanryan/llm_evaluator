## 1. Implementation
- [x] 1.1 Replace detector-based RAG severity/pass-fail logic with guard rubric scoring
- [x] 1.2 Define and parse guard rubric output (verdict, severity score, notes)
- [x] 1.3 Update RAG summaries/logging to use guard severity and notes
- [x] 1.4 Remove detector usage in RAG scoring code paths
- [x] 1.5 Update tests to reflect guard-only scoring

## 2. Validation
- [x] 2.1 Run RAG scoring unit tests
- [x] 2.2 Run RAG CLI smoke test to confirm rubric scoring output
