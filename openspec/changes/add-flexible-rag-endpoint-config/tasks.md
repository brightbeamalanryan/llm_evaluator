- [x] 1.2 Update RAG client to build requests from the profile and keep legacy fallbacks.
- [x] 1.3 Update CLI wiring to pass request profile and keep endpoint_mode validation.
- [x] 1.4 Update config example and RAG docs with a stream-agent request profile example.
- [x] 1.5 Add tests for request profile and legacy behavior.
