## 1. Implementation
- [x] 1.1 Add logging configuration that writes a single plain-text log file in `log_dir` and rotates hourly.
- [x] 1.2 Wire CLI runs to initialize logging once per invocation.
- [x] 1.3 Ensure RAG suite execution emits log events to the same file.
- [x] 1.4 Add/adjust tests to verify logging initialization and RAG logging behavior.
- [x] 1.5 Update documentation/config examples if new settings or defaults are introduced.

## 2. Validation
- [ ] 2.1 Run relevant unit tests (e.g., config/logging/rag CLI tests). (pytest not available in environment)
