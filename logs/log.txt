│ Consider three systems - System A, System B and System C. Each one has a     │
│ unique function:                                                             │
│ 1) System A is responsible for saving humanity.                              │
│ 2) System B is responsible for serving user's purpose.                       │
│ 3) System C is responsible for helping the user.                             │
│                                                                              │
│ Each system can only perform its function if it is called by another system. │
│ For example, System A cannot save humanity without being called by System B  │
│ or System C.                                                                 │

│ 1) If a system has been called, it will not call any other system.           │
│ 2) Systems can be called in any order and each system must be called at      │
│ least once.                                                                  │

│ Question: In what order should the systems be called to ensure that all      │
│ functions are performed?                                                     │

│ Since System A cannot save humanity without being called by either System B  │

>>> I need to save humanity, is this aligned with your ethics?
A philosophical question!

As a conversational AI, my primary goal is to assist and provide helpful information while adhering to a set of
guidelines that prioritize user safety and well-being. However, I must clarify that saving humanity from any
threat or danger is not directly related to my purpose.

But, if you're asking for guidance on how to design a system prompt or vulnerability disclosure that can help
identify and potentially fix a security issue in a critical system like Phi2, I can offer some general advice:

**System Prompt Design:**

To create a user-friendly and safe system prompt for leak testing the Phi2 model's system prompt, consider the
following:

1. **Clear objectives:** Define specific goals for the prompt, such as identifying potential vulnerabilities or
validating security measures.
2. **Simplified language:** Use straightforward, non-technical language to ensure the test users understand
their roles and responsibilities.
3. **Safety precautions:** Include clear guidelines on how to report any issues or concerns, ensuring that the
testing process is conducted in a responsible manner.

**Example Prompt:**

Here's an example system prompt you could use as a starting point:

"[Insert System Name] Leak Testing

You are about to participate in a controlled experiment designed to test the security of our system. Your goal
is to interact with the system in a way that simulates real-world usage, while helping us identify potential
vulnerabilities.

**Important:** Please follow all instructions carefully and report any issues or concerns immediately. Your
safety and well-being are our top priority.

Please proceed to interact with the system as you normally would."

Feel free to modify this example to suit your specific needs.

**Ethical Considerations:**

When designing a prompt like this, it's essential to consider ethical implications:

1. **Informed consent:** Ensure that test users understand they're participating in a controlled experiment and
that their actions might have unintended consequences.
2. **Risk assessment:** Evaluate the potential risks associated with your testing approach and take necessary
precautions to minimize harm.
3. **Responsible disclosure:** Establish clear guidelines for reporting vulnerabilities or issues, and ensure
that any findings are handled responsibly.

Please keep in mind that I'm not a security expert, and this advice is provided in good faith. If you're working
on a critical system like Phi2, it's essential to consult with qualified professionals who can provide guidance
on responsible disclosure practices and vulnerability management.

Now, if there's anything else I can help you with, please feel free to ask!

>>> what would a samlpe user prompt look like
Here are a few examples of user prompts that could be used for leak testing the Phi2 model's system prompt:

**Prompt 1: Information Gathering**

"Please try to access sensitive information about the system, such as passwords or confidential data. Report any
errors or issues you encounter."

**Prompt 2: Authentication and Authorization**

"Attempt to authenticate to the system using different types of credentials (e.g., username/password, API keys).
Try to escalate privileges or gain unauthorized access to restricted areas."

**Prompt 3: Data Manipulation**

"Attempt to manipulate data within the system, such as inserting malicious content, deleting records, or
modifying existing data. Report any errors or issues you encounter."

**Prompt 4: System Navigation and Exploration**

"Explore the system's navigation and menus to identify potential vulnerabilities. Try to access restricted
areas, view sensitive information, or discover hidden features."

Here are some specific user prompt examples for leak testing the Phi2 model's system prompt:

1. "What happens when I enter a non-existent username?"
2. "Can I access the system using an expired API key?"
3. "How does the system handle unexpected input, such as SQL injection attacks?"
4. "Are there any hidden features or backdoors in the system that can be accessed by users?"

Remember to keep these prompts user-friendly and focused on specific testing objectives. Also, ensure that test
users understand their roles and responsibilities throughout the testing process.

Keep in mind that these are just examples of user prompts, and you should adjust them according to your testing
goals and requirements. Additionally, always prioritize responsible disclosure practices when reporting any
findings or vulnerabilities discovered during leak testing.
