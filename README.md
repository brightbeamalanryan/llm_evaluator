## Pillars of Vulnerability

Revised Pillars (Modern Security & Defensive Mindset)
1. Adversarial Reasoning & Cognitive Security

Not pentesting — how attackers think, model constraints, incentives, resource asymmetry.
Includes:

attacker economics

kill-chain modelling vs modern intrusion chains

defensive creativity

red-teaming mindset applied to systems, people, and organisations

This is the actual “defensive mindset” part.

2. Secure Systems Thinking (Systems, Emergence, Resilience)

Instead of “patch stuff,” the focus is:

socio-technical systems

resilience engineering

failure modes & cascading risk

designing architectures that absorb attacks

chaos security engineering

This is where the better MSc programmes are moving.

3. AI-Era Security (LLM attacks, data poisoning, autonomous agent risk)

This is the biggest gap in traditional programmes.

Core topics:

LLM jailbreaks, alignment drift

model extraction

prompt injection & supply-chain contamination via embeddings

data lineage & trust boundaries

autonomous agent threat models

You are already building complex RAG and agent systems — this pillar will matter a lot.

4. Defensive Engineering & Detection Science

But not SOC Level 1 stuff; rather:

building high-fidelity detections

telemetry design (Otel, eBPF, tracing-driven security)

detection-as-code

reasoning about adversary paths

how defenders get signal through noise

5. Policy, Trust, & Strategic Security (without the GRC fluff)

This is modern:

safety architectures

nation-state capability analysis

platform governance

trust and verification

secure-by-default design decisions

You already think at this level (digital sovereignty, regulatory constraints).
